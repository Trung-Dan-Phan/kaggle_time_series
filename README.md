# X/HEC Time Series 2024 - Air Quality in Paris Forecasting

Air quality in urban areas is a critical factor affecting the health and well-being of millions. Paris, a bustling metropolis, continuously monitors its air pollutants to safeguard public health and inform policy decisions. In this competition, your challenge is to predict hourly concentrations of five key pollutants—CO, NO₂, O₃, PM10, and PM2.5—over a three-week period using historical data.

This Kaggle challenge was done as part of an introductory lecture on time series analysis by Capgemini Invent, offering a practical application of forecasting techniques on real-world environmental data. By accurately predicting pollutant levels, you can contribute to better air quality management and public health initiatives.

The task is to develop models that forecast the hourly levels of these pollutants based on provided historical measurements. This involves analyzing temporal patterns, trends, and potential seasonal effects within the data to make informed predictions.
